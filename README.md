# Etch-a-Sketch (HTML, CSS, JS)
## In browser Etch-a-Sketch features: 
- Resizeable flexbox grids (1x1 - 100x100 cells)
- Color Switching
- Button to clear painted grid
- Click and drag painitng
- Paint over the same cell to make the color darker
- **Note**: 
    - Clicking and dragging may get stuck when clicking on the borders of cells. 
    - This means hovering over cells without clicking will paint them. 
    - You will see a "Stop" icon (circle with diagonal line through it) when this happens. 
    - Can be resolved by clicking again, the paint when hovering will stop and you may resume clicking and dragging. 
        - You can also just make this happen if youre tired of clicking and dragging.
        - Its not a bug, its a feature ;)
